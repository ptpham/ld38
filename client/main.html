      Welcome to your new job as a collaborative, distributed, ground traffic controller!
      <br /><br />
      Your goal is to help fellow citizens get to and from their home and
      workplace and make as much money as possible!
      </p>

      <div class="home">
        <svg style="fill:{{ teamColor }}" viewbox="0 0 300 300">{{> hexagon}}</svg>
        <p>
          These tiles represent the homes of citizens on your team.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="work">
        <svg style="fill: rgb(255, 206, 58)" viewbox="0 0 300 300">{{> hexagon}}</svg>
        <p>
          These tiles are workplaces. Each citizen will randomly be assigned a
          workplace. Citizens may become excited and switch workplaces when a
          new one appears on the map.
          <br /><br />
          Taxes are accumulated at these locations when your citizens make a
          complete loop from their workplace to their home. Click on them to
          collect the taxes for your team. Work places can only store {{maxTax}}
          tax, so collect it as soon as possible!
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="rival">
        <svg style="fill:{{ rivalColor }}" viewbox="0 0 300 300">{{> hexagon}}</svg>
        <p>
          These are the homes of citizens on our rival team.
          Try to make their commutes extra terrible.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Road intersections will have stop lights.
        Click on a path in the intersection to change the light.
        Traffic lights have a cool down so you can't change them too fast!
        They will switch randomly so keep an eye on them for optimal traffic management!
        <br /><br />
        As you collect taxes, you'll be able to contruct new homes or roads on the map.
        Click on a land tile near a road to begin the process. When your team has the resources,
        land tiles on which you can build will be highlighted a lighter green color.
        An intersection may not involve more than three roads. It costs
        <b>{{ roadCost }} to build a road</b> and
        <b>{{ homeCost }} times the number of homes your team currently owns to build a new home</b>.
        <br/><br/>
        Drag your mouse to move and hold shift to rotate the camera.
        <br/><br/>
        Currently there is a bug that may cause you to not see cars from houses that you have just built. Refresh the page to see the new cars. =(
